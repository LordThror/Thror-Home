    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1> <br>
    <p style="margin-top:2px;">I'm a rookie website developer (I know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) and a game programmer on the popular block-based coding site <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. I also enjoy writing stories and world-building, which I try to incorporate into my games when I can, as well as playing strategy board games like Catan, Pandemic, and Chess, which I sadly always lose. Anyways, you can check out what I'm up to by scrolling down below to the news section, or you can check out some other cool people by scrolling down below that! If you want to see more specifically what I create, you can click some of the links on the banner on the top! Thanks for visiting :D !</p>

		  <h1><em>Dreamtale: Order</em> Reflections</h1>
	<img src="https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/project/465001430_288x216.png"> 
   <p class="news-text"><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/465001430/" target="_blank">Dreamtale: Order</a> is the final edition of Dreamlands, besides probably some updates. I'd like to add some more sound effects and of course fix any bugs that players might encounter. I've dedicated a lot of my time to this project, and though it may not be perfect, I feel that I've accomplished something. When I started out making Dreamlands with mental images of Dreams and Nightmares, I thouhgt I was just going to make a quick, simple, casual RPG. It didn't turn out that way. What started as a quick maybe a month long at most project turned into a multiple month project. Some of this is due to a draining of my motivation at times and some real life complications like school and growing up, but I kept at it. And now I've finished it. <br><br> I'm not sure what projects I'll make after this. I really like the whole "world of dreams" concept I've come up with, and I'd like to expand that world. Perhaps make a completly open world project based on it, but that's really all dreaming. For now, I think I'll sit back and make some updates to <em>The Dead of Winter</em>, which has really the same background story as <em>Dreamtale: Order</em>. I've gotten mostly positive feedback on it, except that it's too easy and repetive, which I aim to fix with additional monsters, a boss, and some secrets...<br><br> - Thror </p>
