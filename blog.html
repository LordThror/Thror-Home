       <h1>Dreamlands Ghost Art</h1>
       <p class="post-text">I drew this in pixilart.com. I had this image in my head for a long time, when I began to brainstorm ideas for a Dreamlands sequel (I'm probably not going to make it.). This would the main villian, which isn't a nightmare, but more of a living memory. A thought it would be something that the play loved, but forgotten, such as a friend he left or something he neglected. Dazzling suggested that it would be better if this represented unresolved pain or hate in the player's life, which makes more sense to me. If I ever do make it I am not looking forward to animating this since it's main attack would probably be slashing things with it's tendrils. The tendrils are supposed to end in sort of a blaze of energy that slowly disintegrates. I like how this turned out, and I think the story idea has potential, but whether or not it'll become a sequel I don't know.</p>

       <h1>The Feelings of Dreamlands</h1>
       <p class="post-text">These are the major new NPCs for Dreamlands. Once you've met them, they will follow you and give you buffs. I haven't yet decided on the names for all of them yet. The purple one, Joy, has already been revealed. The yellow one is called Calm and the blue one is Trust. They can only be harmed by the Master Nightmare. I really like how the look a little like Dreams, but contrast with them because of their brighter colors, which is a little like Feelings and Dreams are like in real life.</p>

       <h1>Monster Melee: The Final Masterpiece from the Cloud Master</h1>
       <p>Image by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/RendHeaven/">RendHeaven</a>.</p>
       <p class="post-text">We've been being treated big time on Scratch lately it seems. First Exterra War and now, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/423818358/">Monster Melee</a>, the grid-based strategy battle game by the RPG and cloud master <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/RendHeaven/">RendHeaven</a>. This is likely the last game he will make, but he is staying on to keep it up to date. The game centers over commanding three monsters, each with a unique ability (Called an Ultimate) plus several different spells you can equip. You face an opponent and have to take down his three monster strong army, resulting in a strategic slugfest. It also has a few different maps to spice things up. I enjoyed MM more then any of the so called "Simple RPGs". However, I would still say that Simple RPG 3 is the brighest gem in Rend's crown. MM is an amazing game, it also probably has the best grpahics of the four, with original art done by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Kneebones/">Kneebones</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/AmboraStalis/">AmboraStalis</a>. Be sure to check them out, and definitly be sure to check out MM! RendHeaven's legacy continues.</p>

       <h1>Exterra War Episode One: Out of the Shadows Part One (Spoilers Review)</h1>
       <p>Image by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/smorrebrot/">@smorrebrot</a>.</p>
       <p class="post-text">After a month of hype, the first episode of the Exterra War has been shared! This alien invasion series (Directed, animated, and produced by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mister_dazzling/">mister_dazzling</a>.) is the second major installment of dazzling's lore (Though there have been many minor entries). The first episode launches the story off to a good start. Cador has returned, fresh from winning his court case, to home. Meanwhile, the aliens imprisoned at ECO (Extra-terrestial Containment Organization) have become tired of, you know, being prisoners. Their leader, Split (Voiced by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheCodeMan2000/">TheCodeMan2000</a>), begins a breakout, and sends a warning to the rest of Earth. The aliens wants revenge. The animation is up to Dazzling's par (Which far exceeds practically everyone else's average), and the episode leaves off at a cliffhanger, helping pull you into the story more. The series is off to a very good start.</p>

      <h1>Dreamlands User Interface Sneak Peak</h1>
      <p class="post-text">This is the new UI that I've made for Dreamlands. I've moved the level and health bars from the right of the invetory to above it to create more space. In this space I moved the "Help" Button and added a "Guide" button. Pressing the "Guide" button opens a new menu with a condensed version of the information I have on the <a href="https://lordthror.github.io/Dreamlands-Official-Guide/">Dreamlands Webpage</a>. I had the ide aof making the guide while I was making the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/412742768/">Beta Version</a>, but never added it because I wanted to focus my effort on implementing the changes that were suggested by the players. I'm not sure how helpful it will be since this RPG is so short, but if I ever copy this and make a more open world RPG it will be more helpful.</p>

      <h1>Dreamlands NPC Reveal: Joy</h1>
      <p class="post-text">This is one of the new NPCs I am adding to Dreamlands. Her name is Joy, and is one of the Feelings that the player discovers he is lacking. The rest of her storty details I want to keep secret for now. Her ability is granting XP buffs to the player after it is charged. There are two other Feelings that the player finds, each with their own ability, but I find this one is likely the most visually appealing.</p>

      <p class="post-text">This pixel profile picture was made for me by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mister_dazzling/">@mister_dazzling</a>. I've switched to other profile pictures, but I've always eventually swapped back to this one. I really like the details on the mohawk,glasses, and the shadows. The stripes also do a lot to make it interesting. mister_dazzling is also a very good friend of mine, and that makes this one more special. </p>
